'The idiot'

Designing Steps:

1) Distribute the cards to both the players.
2) Each player will be given an opportunity to swap the cards from faceUp and the playable.
	(this will be implemented later)
3) Start the game
	a) Each player makes a move
	b) After every move:
		-> check if the move is valid: the choice and count of cards from the given
		   cards(playable) must be valid
		   	-> if Valid, then the player picks the same number of cards from the top
		   	   of the deck
		   	-> else, ask the player to make his move again
		   	(just for this design, if a player makes more than 3 incorrect moves, 
		   	 he/she is deemed loser, and the other player automatically wins)
		-> the move is made alternately until the deck is completely empty
		-> at every move, if a player is unable to play by dropping card(s) of value
		   greater than that of the topmost card on the board, then all the cards on the 
		   board is taken by that player
		-> if at any time, 
			-> a player plays a 2, he can continue (wild card), gets another turn
			-> if a player plays a 10, the board cards are emptied (BURNT)
		-> once the deck is empty, the play is made with the playable cards without drawing cards, and the goal is to empty the cards at hand.
		-> once the playable cards are emptied, the player can use the faceup cards, 
		   and then the facedown cards.
		-> the face down cards wont be visible to the user/player.
		-> a player wins if on making his move, he is left with no cards!
